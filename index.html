<p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018.</p>

<p> While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became a resounding success â€“ drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a cultural phenomenon.</p>

<u><h2 id="CS">Consumables</h2></u>
<p>Consumables are items that can only be used one time. Once consumed, they are removed from your inventory. Fortnite foraged items are consumable food items that spawn around the island in specific areas, and when you chomp them down you'll receive a small increase to your health and/or shield depending on what the item is.</p>
<b>More about Consumables</b>
<p>There's been a huge shake up to the way Fortnite foraged items work now, as in addition to consuming them for a health or shield boost, for the first time you can now gather and store these fruits and vegetables in your inventory for later use. Individually they don't provide a huge benefit, but now you can carry them in stacks of up to 15 items each they can be as effective as other Fortnite healing items such as bandages. As well as finding them on their own, you can also search Noms boxes which drop a handful of consumable food items, so there's more ways to eat than ever before.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some <b>Consumables</b> in Fortnite:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Corn</li>
  <li>Cabbages</li>
  <li>Mushroom</li>
  <li>Slurpshrooms</li>
  <li>Coconuts</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Chillies</li>
</ul>
<br>
<u><h2 id="HS">Healables</h2></u>
<p>Fortnite Battle Royale gives players several ways to manage their health and stay alive as the game progresses. Each player has both a Health bar of 100 hit points as well as a shield bar that can be added to that for an additional 100 hit points. Using these different items at the correct times can wind up being the difference between placing first and getting taken out early in the game.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some <b>Healables</b> in Fortnite:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mini Shield Potion</li>
  <li>Shield Potion</li>
  <li>Med Kits</li>
  <li>Bandages</li>
  <li>Slurp Juices</li>
  <li>Chugjug</li>

<u><h2 id="POI">PoI in Fortnite Battle Royale</h2></u>
<p> A Point Of Interest (POI) is a location on the Battle Royale map that can be found popular or interesting to players. The Battle Royale Island is the main battle arena of Battle Royale. It consists of an eight-by-eight (formerly ten-by-ten) grid with many major named locations and minor points of interest.</p>
