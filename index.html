<p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative shooter-survival game for up to four players to fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and Fortnite Creative, where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. Save the World and Battle Royale were released in 2017 as early access titles, while Creative was released on December 6, 2018.</p>

<p> While the Save the World and Creative versions have been successful for Epic Games, Fortnite Battle Royale in particular became a resounding success – drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming a cultural phenomenon.</p>

<h2><b><u>Season 3 Chapter 2 is here!</u></b></h2>

<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cox1mdl5AO0" class="update">Here are the latest updates!</a></b>
<br>
<br>
<u><b>Map Changes</b></u>
<p>Leading up to the season, The Device left a lasting effect on Fortnite’s map. The south-west and east are now flooded, with Slurpy Swamp, The Rig, Lazy Lake, and Misty Meadows largely underwater.</p>
<u><b>New Weapons</b></u>
<p>A new shotgun has been introduced to Fortnite in Chapter 2, season 3. The Charge Shotgun has four variants, all the way up to legendary. It has a relatively small magazine, and its reload time is on the long side, but its damage is lethal.
Three character-based weapons have also been added to the game, focusing on Kit. Ocean’s Burst Assault Rifle, Kit’s Shockwave Launcher, and Kit’s Charge Shotgun have all made their way to Fortnite.</p>
<u><b>New Vehicles</b></u>
<p>You can ride around on sharks in Chapter 2, season 3. They’re deadly and can deal damage, but if you hook them with a fishing pole, they’re yours for the taking. Annoying Marauders, though, and whirlpools will get in your way.</p>
<p>Cars are expected to release later in the season, but for now, players will have to make do with sharks.</p>
<br>
<br>
<b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRqYyLTsa5M&t=6s">The Battle Pass</a></b>
<p>The Battle Pass will once again play an important part in the season and although we're unsure what it will include, we can expect plenty of skins, emotes, pickaxes and gliders.
It will likely be the same price, costing 950 V-Bucks for the battle pass - this is about £7-8.

You can also obtain the Battle Pass Bundle, which will cost 2800 V-Bucks and rewards you with access to the first 25 tiers of the Battle Pass immediately.

This season it will take 7,560,000 XP to reach max rank.</p>

<u><h2 id="CS">Consumables</h2></u>
<p>Consumables are items that can only be used one time. Once consumed, they are removed from your inventory. Fortnite foraged items are consumable food items that spawn around the island in specific areas, and when you chomp them down you'll receive a small increase to your health and/or shield depending on what the item is.</p>
<b>More about Consumables</b>
<p>There's been a huge shake up to the way Fortnite foraged items work now, as in addition to consuming them for a health or shield boost, for the first time you can now gather and store these fruits and vegetables in your inventory for later use. Individually they don't provide a huge benefit, but now you can carry them in stacks of up to 15 items each they can be as effective as other Fortnite healing items such as bandages. As well as finding them on their own, you can also search Noms boxes which drop a handful of consumable food items, so there's more ways to eat than ever before.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some <b>Consumables</b> in Fortnite:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Apples</li>
  <li>Corn</li>
  <li>Cabbages</li>
  <li>Mushroom</li>
  <li>Slurpshrooms</li>
  <li>Coconuts</li>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Chillies</li>
</ul>
<br>
<u><h2 id="HS">Healables</h2></u>
<p>Fortnite Battle Royale gives players several ways to manage their health and stay alive as the game progresses. Each player has both a Health bar of 100 hit points as well as a shield bar that can be added to that for an additional 100 hit points. Using these different items at the correct times can wind up being the difference between placing first and getting taken out early in the game.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some <b>Healables</b> in Fortnite:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mini Shield Potion</li>
  <li>Shield Potion</li>
  <li>Med Kits</li>
  <li>Bandages</li>
  <li>Slurp Juices</li>
  <li>Chugjug</li>
  <li>Bandage Bazooka</li>
  <li>SlurpFish</li>
  <li>Floppers</li>
  <li>Small Fry</li>
</ul>

<u><h2 id="POI">PoI in Fortnite Battle Royale</h2></u>
<p> A Point Of Interest (POI) is a location on the Battle Royale map that can be found popular or interesting to players. The Battle Royale Island is the main battle arena of Battle Royale. It consists of an eight-by-eight (formerly ten-by-ten) grid with many major named locations and minor points of interest.</p>
